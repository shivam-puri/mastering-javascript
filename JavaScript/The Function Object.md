The `Function` object in JavaScript provides methods for creating and working with functions. While it doesn't have a wide range of [[Terms & Facts#Methods vs Internal Methods|internal methods]]  and properties like some other built-in objects, it does have some internal properties and methods that are used internally by JavaScript engines. Let's explore these:

### 1. Internal Properties:
   - [[** [[Prototype  __proto__ & prototype chain|Prototype]] **] ]: Like all JavaScript objects, the `Function` object has an internal `[[Prototype]]` property that points to the prototype object from which it inherits methods and properties. This prototype object is the same as `Function.prototype`.

### 2. Internal Methods:
   - **`[[Call]]`**: This internal method is invoked when a function is called or invoked using parentheses `()`. It executes the function's code and sets the context (`this` value) appropriately.
   - **`[[Construct]]`**: This internal method is invoked when a function is used as a constructor with the `new` operator. It creates a new object, sets the context (`this` value) to that object, and executes the function's code.

### 3. Properties and Methods of Function.prototype:
   - The `Function` object shares methods and properties with its prototype object, `Function.prototype`. These include:
     - **`apply()`**, **`call()`**, **`bind()`**: Methods for setting the context (`this` value) and passing arguments to functions.
     - **`toString()`**: Returns a string representing the source code of the function.
     - **`length`**: Specifies the number of arguments expected by the function.
     - **`name`**: Represents the name of the function.

### 4. Example:
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
   }

   console.log(greet.length); // Output: 1
   console.log(greet.name); // Output: greet
   console.log(greet.toString()); // Output: "function greet(name) { return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'; }"
   console.log(greet.prototype);
   ```

### 5. Conclusion:
   - While the `Function` object itself doesn't have a wide range of internal methods and properties, it inherits methods and properties from its prototype object, `Function.prototype`.
   - The internal methods `[[Call]]` and `[[Construct]]` are used by JavaScript engines to execute function code and handle function invocation and construction.
   - Understanding the `Function` object's internal mechanisms can provide insight into how functions are created, invoked, and manipulated in JavaScript.

# Function vs functions

The relationship between functions and the `Function` object in JavaScript is fundamental to understanding how functions are created, manipulated, and utilized within the language. Let's explore this relationship in depth:

### 1. Functions as Objects:
   - In JavaScript, functions are considered`first-class objects`, meaning they can be treated just like any other object.
   - As objects, functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures.

### 2. Functions as Instances of `Function`:
   - Every function in JavaScript is actually an instance of the built-in `Function` object.
   - When you create a function using either a function declaration or a function expression, you're essentially creating an instance of the `Function` object.

### 3. `Function` Object as a Constructor:
   - The `Function` object serves as a constructor for creating new function objects dynamically.
   - It provides a way to create functions at runtime by passing strings representing the function body and its parameters.

### 4. Creating Functions with `Function` Constructor:
   - You can create functions dynamically using the `Function` constructor by passing strings representing the function parameters and body.
   - However, using the `Function` constructor directly is discouraged due to security vulnerabilities and performance concerns.

### 5. Relationship Overview:
   - Functions are instances of the `Function` object, meaning they inherit properties and methods from the `Function` prototype.
   - The `Function` object provides methods for creating, manipulating, and working with functions in JavaScript.

### 6. Example:
   ```javascript
   // Function declaration
   function greet(name) {
       return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
   }

   // Function expression
   var add = function(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   };

   // Creating function dynamically with Function constructor
   var multiply = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a * b;');

   console.log(greet instanceof Function); // true
   console.log(add instanceof Function); // true
   console.log(multiply instanceof Function); // true
   ```

### 7. Conclusion:
   - Functions in JavaScript are closely related to the `Function` object, as they are instances of it.
   - The `Function` object provides the infrastructure for creating, manipulating, and working with functions dynamically in JavaScript.
   - Understanding this relationship is crucial for effectively using functions and the `Function` object to write expressive and powerful JavaScript code.
